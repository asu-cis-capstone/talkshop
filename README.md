#Talkshop
##Overview

TalkShop is a web application that facilitates connections between guest speakers and teachers. Often times, teachers have a difficult time finding a speaker within a particular field who is nearby or in the area. This website will allow teachers to search through various speaker profiles in order to find the perfect candidate. Speakers will have the ability to create a profile and put their best foot forward so that they may acquire multiple opportunities. TalkShop will prove to be a very valuable tool in the learning environment. 
  
TalkShop was conceived at Startup Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona on November 14th, 2014. The original masterminds of the idea include Dr. Joseph Clark of Arizona State University, Shelly Love of Grand Canyon University, and Karyn Zogopoulos. Dr. Clark presented the idea to his systems design course and recruited a team of information systems students to implement the website. With the team officially assembled, TalkShop is on its way to becoming a reality!

##Moving Forward
As of now, Talk-Shop.net is live and fully functional. Users are able to register, login, create a profile, and connect with teachers or speakers with ease. The team does not intend on making any further changes beyond this point; however, we will continue to encourage people to visit the site and recruit new members. As for future TalkShop development teams, we have comprised a list of suggestions for enhancing the website:
*New Domain: The clients wish to transfer the site to http://www.talkshopspot.com. A temporary fix would be to redirect; however, the task should be fairly simple. This should be addressed immediately. 
*Listings: Currently, when users choose to create a profile, they fill out information about themselves and the bio is then posted to the speaker or teacher profile pages. Instead of users searching through profiles, implement a functionality that allows users to only post a listing for what they need at that point in time. Similar to creating an ad on Craigslist, consider developing a “Create a Listing” button that will include the date and time a speaker is needed and the particular topic the teacher is looking for. 
*Edit Account Info: At this point, there is no way for a user to edit their account information. If they want to update their profile, they must delete their current one and start over. This is very inconvenient and should be considered a top-priority moving forward. 
*Premium Listings: As the site gains more users, it may be beneficial to offer premium listings at a reasonable price. Speakers could have the option to pay for a more visible space on the website so that they can acquire more business.
*Rating System: Developers should consider implementing a rating system in which teachers could rate speakers on their performance. Perhaps you could correlate the rating with the position of the speaker on the page, meaning the higher the rating, the more visible the speaker is on the site. Developers could also add rating into the search criteria.
